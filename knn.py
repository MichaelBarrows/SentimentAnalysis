# description:
#   This function implements the K-Nearest Neighbours classification algorithm, and
#       trains it on the training data (training_instances_bow). Once the
#       algorithm has been trained, it then makes predictions using the test
#       data (test_instances_bow). The precision, recall and f_score are
#       generated using the test predictions and the actual labels. These values
#       are then returned.
